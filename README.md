Carbonate rocks exhibit complex, multi-scale features that challenge traditional imaging techniques. To overcome the trade-off between field of view and resolution, we developed a Swin Transformer-based approach that captures long-range features. This method reconstructs high-resolution digital rock models that closely match real physical properties and predict structures beyond current imaging limits. Additionally, our downsampling strategy preserves high-frequency information while keeping data volumes manageable, offering a more detailed and efficient representation of carbonate rocks.
